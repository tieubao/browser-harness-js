# Browser Harness JS ♞

A model-neutral bridge from agents to Chrome: every CDP method as a typed JS call, plus an opt-in guarded interaction layer for unknown UI decisions.

One persistent WebSocket, 56 domains, 652 typed wrappers, zero wrapping of what Chrome already does.

```
  ● agent: wants to click a button
  │
  ● known deterministic route: use CDP directly
  │
  ● agent writes the CDP call itself        await session.Input.dispatchMouseEvent({...})
  │                                          await session.DOM.setFileInputFiles({...})
  ✓ done — same pattern for all 652 methods
```

**The protocol is the API.** If Chrome can do it, you can call it.

## Installation

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/monotykamary/browser-harness-js
```

Each skill's CLI is symlinked onto PATH by its own `scripts/setup` — run `bash <skill-dir>/scripts/setup` (declared in each skill's `setup` frontmatter field).

Or paste this into your agent — it'll install the skill, put the CLI on your PATH, and run a first task:

```text
Run `npx skills add https://github.com/monotykamary/browser-harness-js`, then
symlink `browser-harness-js` into a directory on my PATH, then use the cdp skill to drive
my browser: look at all the tabs I have open, group them by topic, and screenshot the most
interesting one.
```

(The CLI requires [`node`](https://nodejs.org) on PATH — TypeScript type stripping is on by default from Node 23.6. No runtime is auto-installed.)

**Preferred connect path:** load the unpacked extension at `skills/cdp/extension` (`chrome://extensions` → Developer mode → Load unpacked). The worker relays CDP to the daemon over `ws://127.0.0.1:9876/extension` — no `--remote-debugging-port`, no Allow popup. `session.connect()` uses it when present.

**Fallback:** if Chrome asks you to tick a remote-debugging checkbox, do it — that's how the agent attaches without the extension:

### macOS: Dia's "Allow debugging connection?" prompt

Dia (The Browser Company) is the only Chromium browser that gates the CDP connection behind an `Allow debugging connection?` prompt — **Return** dismisses it. The SDK auto-dismisses it for you (on by default, macOS only, a no-op for every other browser): when the WebSocket open stalls, it fires a Return at the Dia process via `osascript`, so `session.connect()` needs no manual click. Opt out with `autoAllow: false` (or `browser-harness-js --no-auto-allow`).

This needs **macOS Accessibility** for the `node` binary running the SDK. If it's missing, the keystroke is dropped — `osascript` errors `-25211: not allowed assistive access` and `connect()` stalls to `timeoutMs` instead of finishing in ~1s. Grant it once: **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility → add/toggle `node`**. The grant is per binary path, so version managers that install each version at its own path (mise, nvm, asdf) need a re-grant on version bump; a stable-path install (Homebrew) persists across upgrades.

See [skills/cdp/interaction-skills/](skills/cdp/interaction-skills/) for recipes on the mechanics that are not obvious from the CDP method list alone.

## Guarded interactions

Prefer the exact deterministic API route when known. At unknown UI decision
boundaries, default to **guarded observe → act → verify**. Import
`InteractionController` from `skills/cdp/sdk/interaction.ts`, or use the REPL
`createInteractionController({ allowedOrigins: ['https://example.com'] })`
(add `input: 'trusted'` for real mouse and keyboard input).
Every `observe`, `act` and `waitForChange` requires `{scope:{sessionId}}`; no
active-tab routing. See the [API and working snippet](skills/cdp/SKILL.md#guarded-interaction-at-unknown-ui-boundaries).

Observations offer opaque, single-observation targets (64 default / 128 maximum),
explicit truncation, ARIA roles and names (including `aria-labelledby`), safe
control `value` (up to 4096 characters), `checked`/`selected`/`expanded` state and
native `<select>` options. Sensitive controls are excluded using private markers, autocomplete and
conservative naming heuristics; this is not general secret detection/DLP. Exact
bounded identity fingerprints stay in-page; only SHA-256 digests cross CDP
(requires in-page SubtleCrypto, normally HTTPS/localhost). Actions recheck origin, document/connection, native
identity, semantics, visibility, enabled state and occlusion. Cosmetic churn and
layout shifts do not invalidate a target; a change in its meaning does.
Operations are `click`, `type` (replaces the entire value, maximum 4096
characters), `select` (a native `<select>` option) and, with `input: 'trusted'`,
`press` (an allowlisted key). Synthetic mode (the default) activates through the
DOM; trusted mode sends real CDP mouse, text and key input at the rechecked target,
which pointer-driven widgets and autocomplete comboboxes need. Names are computed
from content (a day cell showing "20" is "Tuesday, October 20, 2026"), candidates
carry the named `context` around them, open shadow roots are included, partly
covered controls are used at a clear point, and the page and scroll containers
offer `scroll_down`/`scroll_up`. Iframes, closed shadow roots and canvas remain out
of scope.

`executed` means dispatched, not goal achieved. **stale → reobserve; blocked/denied
→ approval or stop; outcome_unknown → inspect, never blindly retry.** Cancellation
cannot undo a dispatched effect, and GUI actions are not atomic. `close()` is
cooperative; unresolved dispatched calls retain the shared scope queue fence
until settlement. Queues, concurrent waits and retained scopes are bounded, with
explicit capacity failures rather than unbounded growth. Raw CDP/vision
helpers remain intentional fallbacks for unsupported mechanics, not permission
bypasses. Jev is optional; model confidence is never authorization.

Origin allowlists require 1–32 exact origins (maximum 2048 characters each),
and explicit scope session IDs are bounded to 256 characters. Allowlists are
enforced on every guarded observation
and action, including after navigation. They are not a network/navigation firewall
or a sandbox around raw APIs. Session reconnect preserves its authorized settings
and selected transport rather than rediscovering a different browser, increments
a connection generation, and requires scoped callers to reattach.

After updating the SDK, the long-lived daemon needs a user-authorized restart to
load version **0.14.0** and the new globals. File updates alone do not reload it.

## Optional Pi / Fabric connector

The normal Pi extension package in [`pi/`](pi/) owns the `browser-harness`
component and its guarded UI contract. Fabric stays connector-agnostic; it does
not need a browser-specific loader, core registration or Jev/model integration.
With Pi and Fabric available, optionally load it for one invocation or install
it as a local package (commands shown from a sibling checkout):

```bash
pi -e ../browser-harness-js/pi/extension.ts
# Or, persist the normal Pi package registration:
pi install ../browser-harness-js/pi
```

Pi supplies the `typebox` runtime peer and Pi types. `pi-fabric/protocol` is an
optional, **type-only** peer: no Fabric implementation is imported at runtime.
Loading the extension only registers a definition, in either extension load
order. Configuring it loads the adapter but no SDK modules, processes or sockets.
Only explicit `browser.connect` loads Session and connects to the configured
WebSocket (`autoAllow: false`); the interaction module loads on first guarded use.
Provider close releases its controller and session. This does not use the REPL
daemon or discover/approve a personal browser.

Use Fabric's existing component control plane (in `fabric_exec`):

```ts
const definition = await components.describe({ component: "browser-harness" });
const plan = await components.plan({ entries: [{
  id: "browser", component: definition.name,
  config: {
    modulePath: "/trusted/browser-harness-js/skills/cdp/sdk/session.ts",
    interactionModulePath: "/trusted/browser-harness-js/skills/cdp/sdk/interaction.ts",
    wsUrl: "ws://127.0.0.1:9222/devtools/browser/REPLACE_WITH_AUTHORIZED_ENDPOINT",
    allowedOrigins: ["https://example.com"],
    allowedMethods: ["Target.attachToTarget"]
  }
}] });
return plan; // Inspect changes/warnings and obtain approval before applying.
// Later, apply the inspected plan using its original request and revision:
// await components.apply({ ...plan.request, expectedRevision: plan.revision });
```

Paths are explicit trusted SDK modules (absolute, or relative to invocation cwd),
not tied to any sibling layout or bundled inside `pi/`. Required configuration:
`modulePath`, `wsUrl`, `allowedMethods`. Guarded actions also require
`interactionModulePath` plus 1–32 exact `allowedOrigins`; optional
`callTimeoutMs` is 100–60000 (default 10000). `allowedMethods: []` disables raw CDP;
provide an already-authorized session on this connection, or separately grant
`Target.attachToTarget` to attach a known authorized target. Raw grants are exact
method names and **not origin-limited**. No wildcard or implicit origin grants.

Then explicitly call `browser.connect` and use `browser.observe`, `browser.act`
and `browser.waitForChange` with `{scope:{sessionId}}`. `browser.cdp` exists only
with raw grants; page-scoped raw calls also require `sessionId`. Receipts and
cancellation retain the guarded semantics above: unknown outcomes never imply
rollback or permission to retry. Normal Fabric tool/approval policy still applies.

Before the extension is loaded, the definition is unknown to `components.describe`;
configured entries stay `waiting` with `component:browser-harness` missing until
the package is installed **and loaded**. Installing/configuring is not connecting.

Focused offline package tests, from this repository (Node 24+, no SDK suite,
browser, model or credentials):

```bash
cd pi
bun install --ignore-scripts --omit peer  # standalone tests need only dev typebox
node --test tests/*.test.ts
```

## Session recording (rrweb)

Recording is off by default. With explicit consent, the SDK injects [rrweb](https://github.com/rrweb-io/rrweb) into page targets and writes a local event log. Replay is the rrweb Replayer — a fidelity tape of DOM mutations, not a screenshot-compiled explainer.

```bash
recording="$(browser-harness-js 'await session.connect(); await startRecording("demo", "Verify account settings")')"
# Perform and verify the task with browser-harness-js (or let the user browse).
browser-harness-js 'await stopRecording()'
browser-harness-js recordings replay "$recording"
```

The jsonl can contain page content and stays local under `~/.browser-harness-js`; recording therefore requires consent. Form inputs are masked during capture. See [`make-video.md`](skills/cdp/interaction-skills/make-video.md).

## Distribution: cross-agent plugin manifests

Beyond `npx skills add https://github.com/monotykamary/browser-harness-js`, this repo ships manifests so the same skills are discoverable in each agent ecosystem's plugin UI:

- [`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`](.claude-plugin/marketplace.json) — Claude Code plugin marketplace entry (registers `cdp` + the twelve recipe skills as one plugin).
- [`.codex-plugin/plugin.json`](.codex-plugin/plugin.json) — Codex plugin entry with capabilities, default prompts, and brand colors.
- [`skills/cdp/agents/openai.yaml`](skills/cdp/agents/openai.yaml) — OpenAI-agent display metadata.

Each entry lists the same skills as `./skills/<name>`; the per-skill `scripts/setup` still handles PATH symlinking (`browser-harness-js` CLI + each skill's own script).

## Why preserve raw CDP?

A guarded `click` deliberately supports less than `Input.dispatchMouseEvent`,
which has parameters for button, clickCount, modifiers, pointerType, force and
more. Use the guard at unknown UI decision boundaries; use authorized raw CDP
when a deterministic route is known or unsupported mechanics require it.

- Types are the docs. `session.Page.navigate(` triggers autocomplete with the exact params — same JSDoc as the CDP reference.
- No version drift. The SDK is regenerated from the upstream protocol JSON; new Chrome methods appear as soon as you swap the JSON.
- No "helper doesn't handle my case" detours. If CDP can do it, the agent can call it — directly, typed, today.

Alongside `InteractionController`, focused helpers include:
- `listPageTargets()` — filters `chrome://` / `devtools://` out of `Target.getTargets`
- `resolveWsUrl({wsUrl|port|profileDir})` — reads `DevToolsActivePort` for Chrome 144+
- `session.use(targetId)` / `session.waitFor(method, pred, timeout)` — the two routing primitives you genuinely need
- `axView(nodes, opts?)` + `axDiff` / `parseAxRefs` / `axClick` / `axType` — compressed accessibility-tree projection (raw `getFullAXTree` is unusable in context; drops ~96% structural noise and keeps refs you can act on; see `interaction-skills/snapshot.md`)
- `parseAxLocators` / `resolveLocator` / `axClick(locator)` — stable locators (`role` + `accessibleName`) that survive refMap rebuilds where `[n]` refs do not
- `attachSignals()` / `drainSignals()` — drainable digest of dialogs / downloads / navigations / crashes (CDP fires dozens of events; this keeps the handful that change what to do next)
- `pageInfo({ timeoutMs? })` — `url` / `title` / viewport via a timed `Runtime.evaluate`; returns `{ dialog }` when a modal blocks page JS instead of silently hanging
- `help(name?)` — per-helper usage so the model does not need to reload docs to remember an option name
- `listLearnings()` / `learnings(domain, tool?, args?)` — recipe registry over `skills/cdp/learnings/` so per-site selector chains are not re-derived each call (see `skills/cdp/learnings/README.md`)

These optional layers do not remove the raw `session.Domain.method(...)` surface.
Raw access is an intentional escape hatch, never permission to evade a guard denial.

## Contributing

PRs welcome. The best way to help: **contribute a new interaction skill** under [skills/cdp/interaction-skills/](skills/cdp/interaction-skills/) when you figure out the CDP recipe for something non-obvious (a dropdown framework, a shadow-DOM trap, a network-wait pattern).

- Keep recipes in **pure CDP** — `session.Domain.method(...)`, not wrapped helpers.
- Lead with the shortest method call that works; add the workaround or trap afterwards.
- Small and focused beats comprehensive. One mechanic per file.
- Bug fixes, codegen improvements, and `session.ts` refinements are equally welcome.
